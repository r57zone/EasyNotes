Apps support a dark theme with automatic switching during night time.


There is full support for tablets.


If you want to leave the old date when editing a note then on mobile phones you need to click on the date and on the PC hold down the `Shift` key when you click on the done button.


There is a 5-megabyte limit for notes (except PC), you can monitor the available storage in the application settings.

## Setup
### Windows
For Windows there are 2 applications, one is a server application that other client applications synchronize with, and the other is a client application that synchronizes with a server application or web server.

### Android
Install `EasyNotes.apk`, select automatic IP address search or enter a reserved permanent IP of your computer (more on this below). If your router assigns the following IP addresses: `192.168.0.0/15`, `192.168.0.100/115`, `192.168.1.0/15`, `192.168.1.100/115`, `192.168.2.0/15`, `192.168.3.0/15`, then you can simply enable automatic IP address search, and the application will automatically detect your computer.

### iOS 13+
If you want to synchronize directly with a PC or http web server, you need to do the following:
1. Download the archive "EasyNotes.iOS.zip", unzip it to the EasyNotes folder and place the folder in [Apple iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/), also create an `images` folder and move the images from `EasyNotes\images` there.
2. Install the [HTML Viewer Q](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/html-viewer-q/id810042973) application (or any other application that can display HTML and allows Internet connections).
3. Launch the `HTML Viewer Q` application, click the files icon (5th from the bottom). Click on `Browse`, go to iCloud Drive, then to `Applications` and click on the `EasyNotes` folder to move, then move the folder to `iPhone/HTML Viewer`.
4. Next, open `index.html`, then close and reopen the `HTML Viewer Q` application, after which the application will work and all styles will be displayed.
5. In the application settings, you can disable `Tabbed Browsing` to disable the top bar with switching HTML pages.


If you just want to use the application without synchronization or want to synchronize with an https web server, then you need to do the following:
1. Open the Safari browser on your mobile device and enter `https://easynotespwa.github.io` there.
2. Click the `Share` button → `Add to Home Screen`. A shortcut to EasyNotes will appear on the desktop.

### iOS 9-12
1. Open Safari browser on your mobile device and enter `http://IP:735/webapp`, where IP is the reserved permanent IP of your computer.
2. Click the `Share` button → `Add to Home Screen`. A shortcut to EasyNotes will appear on your desktop.

Also, if you have iOS 6-8, you can download and use [the legacy version of the web app](https://github.com/r57zone/EasyNotes/releases/download/0.8.7/EasyNotes.iOS.6-8.support.fix.zip).

### P2P mobile app synchronization (optional, in case of problems)
Check Windows firewall to see if incoming connections are allowed for your network type (private) and allow if disabled.

Next, for Windows, Android and iOS 13+ apps, you can enable automatic IP address search and try to sync. If synchronization does not work or you have an older iOS, try the following:
1. Reserve a permanent IP address for the computer with the Windows app. This is done in the Wi-Fi router settings, in the "DHCP" section.
2. Reserve a permanent IP address for the mobile device and add it, if it is missing, in the Windows app settings. You can also open access for all IP addresses (unsafe). If necessary, delete unnecessary IP addresses.

### Setup web sync
Follow the instructions described [here](https://github.com/r57zone/EasyNotes/tree/master/Source/Web).
